# House Price Prediction Model

## Overview

This Python script implements a basic house price prediction model using multivariate linear regression. It is designed to predict house prices based on features such as lot area, number of bedrooms above ground, and number of full bathrooms. The model is trained using a gradient descent algorithm to minimize the cost function.
